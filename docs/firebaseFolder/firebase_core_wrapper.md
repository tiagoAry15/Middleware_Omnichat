## firebase_core_wrapper.py
This module contains the FirebaseWrapper class, which is designed to manage the connection to a Firebase database. It overrides the `__getattribute__` method to ensure that the connection is updated before any method call, enhancing the reliability and consistency of database interactions. Here are the details of its components:

### Class: FirebaseWrapper
This class acts as a wrapper around Firebase database operations, ensuring that the connection is always updated before any method call.

#### Methods:
- `__init__`: Initializes a new instance of the FirebaseWrapper class.
- `__getattribute__(self, name)`: Overrides the built-in method to update the connection before any method call. It also contains a special condition for the `updateConnection` method to prevent recursion.
- `updateConnection`: This method (to be implemented) will contain the logic to update the database connection. It should be called before any other method invocation to ensure the connection is fresh and reliable.

#### Inheritance Usage:
```python
@singleton
class FirebaseConversation(FirebaseWrapper):
    def __init__(self, inputFirebaseConnection: FirebaseConnection):
        super().__init__()
        self.firebaseConnection = inputFirebaseConnection
```

#### Implementation Usage:
```python
class FirebaseWrapper:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization logic here
        pass

    def updateConnection(self):
        # Logic to update the connection goes here
        pass

    def __getattribute__(self, name):
        if name == "updateConnection":
            return object.__getattribute__(self, name)

        attr = super().__getattribute__(name)
        if callable(attr) and not name.startswith("__"):
            def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
                self.updateConnection()
                return attr(*args, **kwargs)
            return wrapper
        return attr
```

#### Note
The updateConnection method needs to be implemented to establish and update the connection to the Firebase database.

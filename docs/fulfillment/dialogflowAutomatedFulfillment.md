## dialogflowAutomatedFulfillment.py

This module is responsible for automating the setup of the fulfillment URL specifically for Dialogflow. It retrieves the current URL exposed by ngrok and configures it as the new fulfillment URL in Dialogflow. Here are the primary functionalities of this module:

- **Getting the Current ngrok URL**: It utilizes the `get_ngrok_url` function from the `fulfillment.ngrokGetter` module to fetch the current URL exposed by ngrok.
- **Setting the Dialogflow Fulfillment URL**: It uses the `setNewFulfillment` function from the `fulfillment.dialogflowFulfillmentSetter` module to set up the new fulfillment URL in Dialogflow. The new URL is constructed by appending `/webhookForIntent` to the ngrok URL.
- **Logging the Response**: After setting the new fulfillment URL, it logs the response and a success message to the console.

### Usage

To use this module, simply run the script. It will automatically execute the `setDialogflowFulfillment` function to set up the new fulfillment URL and log the necessary information to the console.
